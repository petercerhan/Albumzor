# LPSwipe
An album discovery iphone app, powered by the Spotify API.

## User Experience
* The first time using the app, the user will see a list of artists either from their own phone's library (if access to their media library is granted), or a default list
* The user chooses a few artists to seed the recomendations
* Recomendations load, and the user is presented with albums, which they can either like or dislike (by swiping off the screen or using buttons)
* The user can listen to samples of any of the tracks on a given album (as long as samples are available from Spotify)
* At any time, the user can go to the home screen, where they can view a table of the albums they have liked
* On subsequent uses, the user will start on the home screen

## Running LPSwipe
